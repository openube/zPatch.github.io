## robust textile input

This is the home of zPatch - a textile sensor design aimed at making wearable textile sensors more robust and versetile.

zPatches were presented as a [paper at TEI](www.putthelinkhere).

### How to build a zPatch

A step-by step tutorial on how to build a zPatch zan be found on [Instructables].

We also created a tiny DIY set that we distribute at conferences and events. The DIY set has its own [repo].


### The Code

Once you've built it, zPatch connects to two Analog Inputs of your Arduino. Program it with code you can [find here].


### Evaluation

We demonstrated the robustness and the ability to detect multiple types of input by recording different gestures and classifying them using Random Forest. The recorded data and the software for visualizing and preprocessing the data can be [found here]
