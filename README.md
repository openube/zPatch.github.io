## zPatch - robust textile input

This is the home of zPatch - a sensor design for more robust and versetile textile input.

zPatches were presented as a [paper at TEI](zPatch.github.io/TEI2018_zPatch.pdf).

### How to build a zPatch

A step-by step tutorial on how to build a zPatch zan be found on [Instructables](www.puttheotherlinkhere.com).

We also created a tiny DIY set that we distribute at conferences and events. The DIY set has its own [repo](the.link).


### The Code

Once you've built it, zPatch connects to two Analog Inputs of your Arduino. Program it with code you can [find here](https://github.com/zPatch/zPatch.github.io/tree/master/ArduinoCode). (Tested with Arduino v1.8.2 & Arduino Nano, Uno, Mega2560 and the Sparkfun RedBoard)


### Evaluation

We demonstrated the robustness and the ability to detect multiple types of input by recording different gestures and classifying them using Random Forest.
